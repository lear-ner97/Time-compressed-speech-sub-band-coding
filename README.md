# Time-compressed-speech-sub-band-coding

In this project we applied sub-band coding technique in order to transform an input audio file into a compressed audio file with similar quality. The process was divided into 4 keys steps: 1-implementation of a Finite impulse response 2- decimation 3-quantification 4-interpolation.
